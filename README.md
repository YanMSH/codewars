# This repo contains my solutions of "katas" from [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

README.md is a description, index.js is a solution.

Furthermore, I've got more than hundred of katas, that I've solved. You can find full list [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/YanMSH/completed)

Try to solve it on your own first, then look at mine solution.

Good luck ;)
